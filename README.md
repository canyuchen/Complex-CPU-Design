## Basic MIPS CPU Benchmarks

In this project, we provide two basic benchmark suites for simulation and FPGA on-board evaluation 
of your own multi-cycle MIPS CPU core design. 
You can launch simulation or evaluation with a specified benchmark by explicitly setting 
parameters of benchmark suite name and serial number in MAKE command line.

## Hardware Design

### RTL Design

Please finish your RTL coding for ALU, register file and single-cycle MIPS CPU first 
by editing *alu.v*, *reg_file.v* and *mips_cpu.v* respectively in the directory of 
*hardware/sources/ip_catalog/mips_core* according to 
functional requirements as described in lecture slides of this project. 
If an additional module is necessary in your design, please edit a new source file 
designated with the name of this module in *hardware/sources/ip_catalog/mips_core*
and suppliment instantiation of this module in *mips_cpu.v*.    

1. Using `make HW_ACT=rtl_chk vivado_prj`  
to recursively check syntax and synthesizability of 
all your RTL source files from the top module *mips_cpu_top*. 
Please carefully modify and optimize your RTL code according to 
errors and warnings you would meet in this step.  

2. If there are no errors or warnings occurring in Step 1, 
please use `make HW_ACT=sch_gen HW_VAL=<check_target> vivado_prj`  
to re-launch RTL checking in Vivado GUI mode and 
generate RTL schematics of your specified module name 
by replacing *<check_target>* to a module name located in *hardware/sources/ip_catalog/mips_core*. 
For example, if you want to generate a schematic of reg_file.v, please use  
`make HW_ACT=sch_gen HW_VAL=reg_file vivado_prj`  
The generated schematics in PDF version named *<check_target>_sch.pdf* 
are located in the directory of *hardware/vivado_out/rtl_chk*. 
You can check the generated schematics via a PDF viewer.  

### Behavioral Simulation

1. Executing `make HW_ACT=bhv_sim HW_VAL=<benchmark_suite_name>:<benchmark_serial_nubmer> vivado_prj`  
to run behavioral simulation for your MIPS CPU design using a specified benchmark. 
The valid string of *<benchmark_suite_name>* should be among *medium* and *advanced*.
Behavioral simulatioin using *microbench* suite is **NOT** supported in this project. 
*<benchmark_serial_number>* must be a valid value according to the list of each benchmark suite.
For example, you can launch behavioral simulation of *sum* in *medium* benchmark suite via  
`make HW_ACT=bhv_sim HW_VAL=medium:01 vivado_prj`  
**Please note that only one valid serial number of benchmark should be used in this command**.  

2. After simulation, please use  
`make HW_ACT=wav_chk HW_VAL=bhv vivado_prj`  
to check the waveform of behavioral simulation in Vivado GUI mode. 
You can change (add or remove signals to be observed) 
the waveform configuration file (.wcfg) and save it under Vivado GUI 
when running this step. 
If you want to observe the modified waveform, please re-launch 
behavioral simulation (*HW_ACT=bhv_sim*) and waveform checking (*HW_ACT=wav_chk*). 
If you modify RTL source code to solve problems in logical design, 
please return to RTL checking (*HW_ACT=rtl_chk*) first and walk through the following steps.  

### Post-synthesis Timing Simulation

1. Executing `make HW_ACT=pst_sim HW_VAL=<benchmark_suite_name>:<benchmark_serial_nubmer> vivado_prj`  
to run post-synthesis timing simulation for your MIPS CPU design using a specified benchmark. 
The valid string of *<benchmark_suite_name>* should be among *medium* and *advanced*. 
*<benchmark_serial_number>* must be a valid value according to the list of each benchmark suite.
For example, you can launch timing simulation of *sum* in *medium* benchmark suite via  
`make HW_ACT=pst_sim HW_VAL=medium:01 vivado_prj`  
**Please note that only one valid serial number of benchmark should be used in this command**. 
Post-synthesis simulatioin using *microbench* suite is **NOT** supported in this project. 

2. After simulation, please use  
`make HW_ACT=wav_chk HW_VAL=pst vivado_prj`  
to check the waveform of timing simulation in Vivado GUI mode. 
You can change (add or remove signals to be observed) 
the waveform configuration file (.wcfg) and save it under Vivado GUI 
when running this step. 
If you want to observe the modified waveform, please re-launch 
timing simulation (*HW_ACT=pst_sim*) and waveform checking (*HW_ACT=wav_chk*). 
If you meet problems in timing simulation, please perform static timing analysis via timing report 
to optimize your RTL design and return back to the steps of RTL checking (*HW_ACT=rtl_chk*).   

### Bitstream Generation

1. If you fix logical functions of your RTL code via 
recursive execution from RTL design to post-synthesis timing simulation, 
please launch  
`make HW_ACT=bit_gen HW_VAL=<freq> vivado_prj`  
to generate system.bit in the top-level *hw_plat* directory via automatic 
synthesis, optimization, placement and routing.  
<freq> is an integer value to represent CPU work frequency.   

2. Launching `make bit_bin`  
to generate the binary bitstream file (system.bit.bin) used for FPGA on-board 
evaluation later in the top-level *hw_plat* directory.   

## FPGA Evaluation

We provide an FPGA cloud infrastructure as well as a set of 
local FPGA boards for evaluation of this project, 
both of which use the same set of commands for 
hardware-software co-verification. 
Local FPGA boards can be leveraged only in class, while 
the FPGA cloud is open-accessed any time any where via network 
until the course of this term finishes. 

1. In order to launch evaluation, please use either  
`make USER=<user_name> HW_VAL="<benchmark_list>" cloud_run`  
to connect to the FPGA cloud, or  
`make BOARD_IP=<board_ip> HW_VAL="<benchmark_list>" local_run`  
to connect to a local FPGA board. 
**Please note that *<benchmark_list>* must be kept between quotes.**  

2. Format of *<benchmark_list>* is defined as *<bench_suite_name>[:<bench_serial_number_list>]*, in which "*[]*" notates an optional part.  
* *<bench_suite_name>* must be a valid string between *medium* and *advanced*.  
* An optional *<bench_serial_number_list>* can follow the name of benchmark suite after ":".  
-- For example, if you would like to evaluate *sum*, *max*, *if-else* and *switch* in medium benchmark suite via cloud environment, 
please launch  
`make USER=<user_name> HW_VAL="medium:01 09 05 12" cloud_run`  
You can set various benchmark serial numbers in the list depending on your evaluation demands.  
* If no *<bench_serial_number_list>* is specified, all benchmarks in a certain suite would be evaluated in order.  
-- For example, you can launch   
`make BOARD_IP=<board_ip> HW_VAL="advanced" local_run`  
to make a full evaluation of advanced benchmark suite on local FPGA board.
